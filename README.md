# Taprobane

Taprobane Empire is a global business consultancy built on experience, strategy, and innovation.

We partner with companies worldwide to strengthen operations, drive growth, and unlock lasting value through intelligent, data-driven solutions.

This website was built from the ground up by Meanth Perera.

## Viewing the site locally

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder using a simple local server. From the project root (Windows cmd.exe):

```bat
cd "c:\My Web Sites\taprobane"
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

(You can also open `index.html` directly by double-clicking it, but some features may require a local server.)

If you'd like, I can add a short license, contact details, or move this into `docs/` and add an index page for it.
